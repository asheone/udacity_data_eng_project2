This is a repository for the Udacity's 'Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra' project made by Lukasz Aszyk.

It contains 2 files: `Project_1B.ipynb` and `README.md`.

The first Jupyter notebook file `etl.ipynb`, contains the code prepared for creation of 3 Caasandra tables, required for the second project.
